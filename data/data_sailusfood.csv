Lachha paratha,http://www.sailusfood.com/lachha-paratha-recipe/,"Earlier I had posted a recipe of south indian street food special, parotta, a flaky layered flat bread made with all purpose flour or maida. After I posted it, there are many requests to post north indian lachha paratha recipe with atta. I am sharing a step by step tutorial for making a perfect lachha paratha at home quite effortlessly.",Sailaja Gudivada,60 min,30 min,NULL,"37417, 37418, 37419, 37420, 37408","In a bowl, add atta and salt and mix well to combine. Add a tbsp of oil or ghee and rub into the dough. Slowly, add enough warm water to make a soft yet firm dough. Knead for a few minutes and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes. 
Pinch out small lemon sized balls off the dough. Place one ball of dough on the working surface and dust with flour. 
Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a 7""-8"" diameter flat circle. Drizzle 1-2 tsps oil or ghee and smear all over. Sprinkle a little flour over the greased paratha. 
Staring at one end of the circle, begin folding the rolled out flat bread into 1/2"" pleats. 
Once the pleats are formed, clutch the ends and swing it lightly in the air so that the pleated dough stretches in length. Begin at one end to twirl it around to form a spiral/coil like a swiss roll. 
Make more spirals with the rest of the remaining dough. Place a coiled dough on the working surface and dust with flour.
Roll out the dough into 7""-8"" diameter circle, smear with 1-2 tsp oil or ghee and sprinkle some flour.
Begin to pleat from one end of the circle to form a lengthwise long pleat. Stretch it lightly and form a coil shape out of it. Once all the spirals/coils are prepared, allow to rest for at least half an hour by covering with a damp cloth. 
After resting, place a coiled dough on the working surface and dust it with flour.
Roll out into a flat round 7"" diameter flat circle and place on a pre-heated iron tawa or griddle. Ensure that the griddle is hot before placing the paratha to shallow fry. Allow to cook on medium high flame for 20 seconds undisturbed before flipping it over. Now cook for another 20 seconds and flip it again and cook till brown spots appear. Use a flat ladle to press the paratha allowing the layers to form and puff up. 
Flip once again, drizzle some oil or ghee and roast for a few more seconds before flipping over to the other side and roasting it till well browned and layers appear. You can gently crush the paratha to expose the inner soft layers.
Serve warm with dal makhani or palak paneer or mushroom masala or any curry of your choice.",0
