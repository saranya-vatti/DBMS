Amlas are abundantly available during the winter months. I actually buy a large quantity of this fruit each year to make murabbas.  Whole amlas simmered in a cardamom and saffron flavoured syrup is one of my personal favourites. There are several traditional recipes for making this murabba. Some soak the amlas in alum (phitkari) overnight whilst others sun-dry amlas. I find it easiest to cook the amlas in boiling water to get rid of all its bitter juices. The entire process takes about 2 to 3 days. First the amlas are simmered in a thin sugar syrup and left aside for 2 days during which the amlas slowly and gradually soak in the syrup. On the third day, the syrup is boiled again along with the flavouring to a thick honey like consistency and the amlas are added. The thick syrup helps in the preservation of the murabba and also complements the sharp and acidic amla taste.     When preserved for a long period of time, the syrup of the murabba turns to a dark brown to an almost black colour and takes in all the goodness of the amlas.

Bring a thick piece or bar of chocolate to room temperature (chocolate which is too warm will slice and that which is too cold will grate).
To make the curls, use a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler firmly along the edge of the chocolate to produce long or short curls. Use a skewer or toothpick to transfer the curls to the dessert or cake you wish to garnish or grate it directly on top of the cake.
Melt the chocolate and pour in a thin layer of over 2 mm. (1/12”) on a cool stone or a marble surface. Allow it to set until just firm. Place a sharp knife on the surface of the chocolate at an angle of 45°.
Pull it gently over the surface of the chocolate to form scrolls. The cooler the chocolate, the more will it splinter. Warm chocolate will give a softer, looser curl but if the chocolate is too warm, it is very difficult to handle.

Add the tomato puree and the olives and simmer for a few seconds.
Add the coriander, herbs, salt, pepper and the pasta and toss gently, till the pasta is hot.
Serve hot sprinkled with the paprika.
The secret of cooking pasta is to use ample water. Always cook pasta in a large pan of boiling water with 1 teaspoon of salt  and 1 tablespoon of oil.
Add the pasta to the boiling water by adding a few strands or one sheet of pasta at a time.
Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally and gently until the pasta is tender.
Cooked pasta should be 'al dente' or firm to the bite. Under cooked pasta has a taste of raw flour whereas overcooked pasta will be soft and sticky.
Takes a little longer than the fresh version. Very small pasta may cook in 5 minutes (like spaghetti, dried lasagne sheets), while large shapes may require 10 minutes (like macaroni, fusilli, conchiglie). Fresh pasta will take about 3 to 5 minutes to cook.
Immediately drain the cooked pasta in a sieve or a colander. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to refresh it. Drain again and keep aside.
If the pasta is not used immediately, add 1 tablespoon of oil to it and toss it.
Two cups of dried pasta will yield 3 cups of cooked pasta. This quantity is sufficient for 4 persons.

Actually, it is something that must be experienced and not described! When you think almonds, you expect a nutty flavour, but this Homemade Almond Butter gives you a better flavour than you bargain for, because the nuts are roasted before blending. A dash of coconut oil further improves the flavour of this butter, apart from boosting its health benefits. Almond butter is a great source of  Protein, while coconut gives you healthy fatty acids of medium chain triglycerides. It is always better to make your almond butter at home as store-bought almond butter contains loads of sugar and hydrogenated vegetable fats, which are not good for you. And to think you get all this goodness at probably half the price of the unhealthy market butter! You don’t need to buy big, expensive almonds to make butter, as you are anyway going to blend it. The only thing is that you need a bit of patience, as you have to blend the almonds gradually, switching off the knob after every half a minute. Otherwise, your mixer might heat up. Store your almond butter in a glass jar with a lid and it should stay good for 25 days in the fridge. You can also store the almond butter in a jar at room temperature and it stays good for 15 days. But note that if you put the butter in the fridge, then you must store it there always.  When you are hungry, treat yourself to 1 tbsp of almond butter. It is a wise snack even for weight-watchers as it has the correct fats to keep you full for a longer time.Other good dips and snacks to have are Homemade Peanut Butter , Creamy Thick Curd Dip Using Jalapenos, Olives and Sun-dried Tomatoes , Hummus .",Tarla Dalal,5 mins,5 mins,10 mins ,"43507, 43508","Roast the almonds in a broad non-stick pan for 5 minutes on a medium flame.

It also has allium, which increases the body’s power to fight cancer cells. They carry anti-inflammatory properties too.

It the frothy layer begins to subside, sprinkle the remaining half portion of the flour solution.
After this, keep on sprinkling water (minimum 1 cup) on the surface of the sugar syrup. Ensure that the syrup froths all the time while cooking the raj bhogs.
Cook for about 20 minutes, continuously sprinkling water to enable the froth to form.
Check if the raj bhogs are cooked. This is determined by touch. if the raj bhog springs back and retains it shape when pressed, it is cooked . Another way of checking is to drop a raj bhog in a pan of cold water.

One afternoon when I was left with the task of feeding my hungry grandchildren, I thought of making the most of what was available on my kitchen shelf. I then chanced upon this recipe which has today become very popular amongst my family and friends. It took some time to master the art of making crisp alu tikkis. I use old potatoes (which are commonly referred to as wafer potatoes) to make the tikkis crisp and a slice of soaked bread to not only bind the potatoes but also to make them more crunchy. The paneer filling for tikkis uses tomato purée which adds a sharp tangy taste to it. If you are one of those who would like to avoid deep frying tikkis (all of us think it a crime to eat deep fried food), you can shallow fry on a griddle (tava) using a little oil.
