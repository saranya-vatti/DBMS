Amlas are abundantly available during the winter months. I actually buy a large quantity of this fruit each year to make murabbas.  Whole amlas simmered in a cardamom and saffron flavoured syrup is one of my personal favourites. There are several traditional recipes for making this murabba. Some soak the amlas in alum (phitkari) overnight whilst others sun-dry amlas. I find it easiest to cook the amlas in boiling water to get rid of all its bitter juices. The entire process takes about 2 to 3 days. First the amlas are simmered in a thin sugar syrup and left aside for 2 days during which the amlas slowly and gradually soak in the syrup. On the third day, the syrup is boiled again along with the flavouring to a thick honey like consistency and the amlas are added. The thick syrup helps in the preservation of the murabba and also complements the sharp and acidic amla taste.     When preserved for a long period of time, the syrup of the murabba turns to a dark brown to an almost black colour and takes in all the goodness of the amlas.

Bring a thick piece or bar of chocolate to room temperature (chocolate which is too warm will slice and that which is too cold will grate).
To make the curls, use a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler firmly along the edge of the chocolate to produce long or short curls. Use a skewer or toothpick to transfer the curls to the dessert or cake you wish to garnish or grate it directly on top of the cake.
Melt the chocolate and pour in a thin layer of over 2 mm. (1/12”) on a cool stone or a marble surface. Allow it to set until just firm. Place a sharp knife on the surface of the chocolate at an angle of 45°.
Pull it gently over the surface of the chocolate to form scrolls. The cooler the chocolate, the more will it splinter. Warm chocolate will give a softer, looser curl but if the chocolate is too warm, it is very difficult to handle.

Add the tomato puree and the olives and simmer for a few seconds.
Add the coriander, herbs, salt, pepper and the pasta and toss gently, till the pasta is hot.
Serve hot sprinkled with the paprika.
The secret of cooking pasta is to use ample water. Always cook pasta in a large pan of boiling water with 1 teaspoon of salt  and 1 tablespoon of oil.
Add the pasta to the boiling water by adding a few strands or one sheet of pasta at a time.
Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally and gently until the pasta is tender.
Cooked pasta should be 'al dente' or firm to the bite. Under cooked pasta has a taste of raw flour whereas overcooked pasta will be soft and sticky.
Takes a little longer than the fresh version. Very small pasta may cook in 5 minutes (like spaghetti, dried lasagne sheets), while large shapes may require 10 minutes (like macaroni, fusilli, conchiglie). Fresh pasta will take about 3 to 5 minutes to cook.
Immediately drain the cooked pasta in a sieve or a colander. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to refresh it. Drain again and keep aside.
If the pasta is not used immediately, add 1 tablespoon of oil to it and toss it.
Two cups of dried pasta will yield 3 cups of cooked pasta. This quantity is sufficient for 4 persons.
